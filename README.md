Features
Classic 3x3 Grid: The traditional Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns as 'X' and 'O'.

Interactive UI: Clean and modern design with hover effects and responsive buttons.

Turn Indicator: A status display clearly shows whose turn it is.

Winner Detection: The game automatically detects and announces the winner for all 8 winning combinations.

Draw Detection: Declares a draw if the board is filled with no winner.

Reset Functionality: A "Reset" button allows players to start a new game at any time.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the game board.

CSS3: For all styling, including the modern layout, gradients, shadows, and responsive design using Flexbox and Grid.

JavaScript (ES6): For all game logic, including handling clicks, tracking turns, checking for winners, and resetting the game.

How to Play
The game is played by two players: Player X and Player O.

Player X always goes first.

Players take turns placing their mark ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell on the 3x3 grid.

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all 9 cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
